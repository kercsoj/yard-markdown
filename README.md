# Yard::Markdown

Yard-markdown produces markdown documents for ruby gems.

Goals:
- Compatible with Github Flavored Markdown
- Mimick yard html layout in markdown format as much as possible
- Produce .csv index file alonside markdown documentation

This is a successor to rdoc-mardown gem, so it will very likely be similar to this [example](https://github.com/skatkov/rdoc-markdown/tree/main/example).


Testing:
  `yardoc example.rb` -> outputs everything into doc.
